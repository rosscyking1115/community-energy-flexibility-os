> build on UK public energy data. **Not a product**, and it doesn't need to be

It doesn't just show *"carbon is low at 02:00."* It says *"run the washing machine
02:30–04:00, charge the EV 01:30–04:30, expected saving £0.12 and 0.14 kg CO₂,
high confidence"* — with the assumptions and caveats attached.

> [!TIP]
> **Worked example:** Riverside Community Centre — four flexible loads, no
> batteries, no solar, no smart meter — saves **~£149 and ~179 kg CO₂ a year**
> just by shifting *when* things run. And when the grid came in ~8% dirtier than
> forecast, the plan still realised **108% of its forecast carbon saving**. Read
> the full worked example → [docs/CASE_STUDY.md](docs/CASE_STUDY.md).

## Why this exists

To build and show a complete data path end to end — live public APIs → a
warehouse → an optimiser → a typed API → a front end — on a problem I find
genuinely interesting, not to fill a market gap. There isn't one, and that's
stated up front on purpose:

- **Octopus** already publishes a free [Greener Nights](https://octopus.energy/blog/greener-days-and-nights/)
  forecast and auto-schedules cheapest/greenest charging on Intelligent Octopus Go.
- Free third-party sites — **UK Grid Live**, **Energy Stats UK**, **AgileBuddy** —
  do essentially this on the same public data.

So this is a **learning / personal-utility build**, valued for the engineering on
display rather than as something to adopt. The interesting parts, for a reviewer:

- **Contract-first, typed end to end** — pydantic models → OpenAPI → generated
  TypeScript, so the API and the front end can't silently drift.
- **Graceful degradation by design** — every live feed is TTL-cached with a
  last-good / sample fallback, so an upstream outage never takes the app down.
- **It closes the loop** — a forecast-vs-actual **retro** ("did yesterday's plan
  actually save?") measures realised vs forecast savings, not just predicted ones.

## Live

The engine runs behind a public, keyless API (FastAPI on Fly.io):

**`https://community-energy-flex-api.fly.dev`** — [OpenAPI docs](https://community-energy-flex-api.fly.dev/docs)

```bash
# tonight's cleanest/cheapest window for a load in London, from live data
curl -s https://community-energy-flex-api.fly.dev/v1/optimise \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"region_id":"london","tariff":{"kind":"agile"},"objective":"balanced",
       "tasks":[{"name":"Washing machine","device_type":"Washing machine",
       "energy_kwh":0.8,"duration_hours":1.5,"earliest":"00:00","latest":"08:00",
       "preferred":"06:30"}]}'
```

Endpoints: `/v1/regions`, `/v1/appliances`, `/v1/tariffs/agile/{region}`,
`/v1/forecast/{region}` (the 48-slot carbon + price curve), `/v1/optimise`. Data
is live: GB regional carbon (NESO / National Grid Carbon Intensity) and Octopus
Agile prices, with an EirGrid typical-day profile for Northern Ireland.

The web front end that consumes it — a Next.js app built around a full-day
carbon/price band — lives in [`web/`](web); see
[docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) to run or deploy it.

## What's inside

The full data path, end to end:

- **Optimiser** — rule-based (cheapest / greenest / balanced / avoid-peak) plus an
  LP/MILP optimiser (PuLP) that schedules loads jointly under a peak-load cap. Every
  recommendation carries a baseline comparison, a confidence band, and a caveat.
- **API + front end** — a FastAPI service wrapping the engine (live on Fly.io) and a
  Next.js app wired to it through a server-side BFF (typed end to end).
- **Data** — GB Carbon Intensity API; tariff models (flat / Economy 7 / time-of-use /
  Octopus Agile); Open-Meteo weather.
- **Warehouse** — dbt on DuckDB (dev) with a Snowflake target, plus a reporting star.
- **Orchestration** — a Dagster daily pipeline with keep-last-good-schedule fallback
  and a **forecast-vs-actual retro loop** ("did yesterday's plan actually save?").
- **Apps & reports** — a Streamlit decision app, a Power BI stakeholder dashboard,
  and text / Excel / PDF action reports.
- **Access control** — role-based scoping + an audit trail, enforced in the app and
  (defence in depth) by Snowflake row-access policies.
- **Tracking** — an MLflow comparison of optimiser strategies.

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"          # stdlib-only core + tests
python -m pytest                            # full suite
python -m community_energy_flex cheapest    # end-to-end on sample data
```

Run the decision app:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[app,reports]"
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Run the public API locally:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[api]"
python -m uvicorn community_energy_api.main:app --app-dir api --port 8000
```

Everything else — warehouse, pipeline, LP optimiser, MLflow, Power BI data — is an
optional extra. See [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md) to run each piece.

                                                                                      │

                                    (FastAPI + Next.js)  └── Power BI dashboard  (Snowflake star)
```

The day is 48 half-hour **slots**. Tasks, tariffs, and carbon forecasts are all
expressed in slots, so the optimiser reasons over one clean integer axis. Every
recommendation is compared against a **baseline** (business as usual) and carries a
**confidence** band and a plain-language **caveat**. The maths behind those three is
spelled out in [docs/METHODOLOGY.md](docs/METHODOLOGY.md).

- **Octopus Agile** — live half-hourly unit rates by region (GSP group).
- **EirGrid** — a typical-day carbon profile for Northern Ireland (no live GB feed).
- **Weather** — Open-Meteo (free, no key), for the demand/solar features.

## Status

| Piece | State |

Scope is intentionally **capped** — this is a portfolio build, not a roadmap to a
product. UK region coverage (all 14 GB GSP regions + Northern Ireland) is complete;
no further data or feature expansion is planned.
