"""The forecast-vs-actual retro loop, made visible: "did yesterday's plan
actually save?"

A schedule is committed on the *forecast*. Then the day happens. This runs the
same four community-centre loads once, then re-scores that fixed plan against
several ways the day could actually turn out, and prints what was *realised*
versus what was forecast — the check that turns "we think this saves" into
evidence.

The actuals here are **simulated** to exercise the loop (we don't store the
forecast we made on a past day, so a true historical replay isn't possible); the
retro maths is the real engine (`monitoring/retro.py`). Cost is left certain on
purpose: Agile prices are published day-ahead, so the forecast *risk* is carbon,
not price — which is exactly what the table below stresses.
