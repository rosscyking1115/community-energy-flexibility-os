"""Community Energy Flex decision-support engine.

A decision-support system that recommends when households and small
organisations should run flexible electricity loads, to reduce cost and carbon
while respecting user comfort constraints.

This package holds the domain core: data models, data-source clients, the
optimiser, and reporting. It is deliberately free of heavy runtime
dependencies so the core logic stays fast to test.
